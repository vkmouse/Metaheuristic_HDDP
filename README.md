### This code implements three metaheuristic algorithms, simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA), and search economics (SE) respectively, and a greedy algorithm, hill climbing (HC), to solve the hyper-dense deployment problem for the 5G environment.

### Introduction
[Search economics (SE)](https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2015.447) is a novel metaheuristic algorithm proposed in 2015. The two main differences between SE and traditional metaheuristic are dividing the search space and investing computation resource depending on the potential of each subspace. The simulated results show that the SE-HDDP is able to find a better solution than the HC, SA, and GA compared in this paper.
